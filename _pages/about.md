I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Robotics Program](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics/phd-program-robotics) at Georgia Tech’s Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines ([IRIM](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics)). My home department is [Aerospace Engineering](https://ae.gatech.edu), where I am advised by Prof. [Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu).

My research focuses on risk-aware robotics, specifically developing theoretical guarantees for robust behavior under uncertainty. My primary tools include Variational Inference, Stochastic Control, and Diffusion Models. You can view my [Ph.D. Thesis here](https://hzyu17.github.io/hongzheyu.github.io/files/Hongzhe_Yu_Thesis.pdf), which summarizes my doctoral research.

Previously, I obtained my Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn). As an [Eiffel Scholar](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/france-excellence-eiffel-scholarship-program), I completed a dual-degree program, earning a [Diplôme d'ingénieur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplôme_d%27Ingénieur) from [École Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr) in France. I subsequently returned to SJTU for my Master's degree, working with Prof. [Wei Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hbaEVRMAAAAJ&hl=en), and completed a 2019 internship at CMU's [Intelligent Control Lab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/robotics-groups/intelligent-control-lab/).
