I am a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. I major in the [Robotics Program](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics/phd-program-robotics) at Georgia Tech's Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines ([IRIM](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics)). My home department is [Aerospace Engineering](https://ae.gatech.edu), and I am fortunately under the supervision of Prof. [Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu). I am also pursuing a Master's degree in computer science as my second major.

Prior to Georgia Tech, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I participated in a dual-degree program with [École Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr), France, where I spent 2 years and obtained the [Diplôme d'ingénieur (postgraduate degree in engineering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplôme_d%27Ingénieur). As part of the program, I went back to SJTU to continue my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering.

My research Interest is probabilistic methods in robotics, and stochastic control. My research centers around understanding the risks that robot faces under uncertainties, as well as developing methods to make robots behave robustly under these uncertainties and risks, with a theoretical guarantee. I am interested a broad range of systems and dynamics, such as underactuated systems, hybrid systems, and partially-observed systems. How uncertainty impacts different systems, and how we can develop algorithms to mitegate these impact, are intruiging topics for me. My core tools to approach these problems root back into stochastic calculus, Beyasian inference, and stochastic control.

Here is [my Ph.D. dissertation proposal](/files/Hongzhe_Yu_Proposal.pdf) which summarizes a few research projects that I have done during my precious Ph.D. time period.
