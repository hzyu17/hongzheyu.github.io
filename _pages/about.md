I am a Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. I major in the [Robotics Program](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics/phd-program-robotics) at Georgia Tech's Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines ([IRIM](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics)). My home department is [Aerospace Engineering](https://ae.gatech.edu), and I am fortunately under the supervision of Prof. [Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu). 

My research Interest is probabilistic methods in robotics, and stochastic control. My research centers around understanding the risks that robot faces under uncertainties, as well as developing methods to make robots behave robustly under these uncertainties and risks, with a theoretical guarantee. My core tools to approach these problems root back into stochastic calculus, Beyasian inference, and stochastic control.


Prior to Georgia Tech, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I was sponsored by the [Eiffel scholarship program](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/france-excellence-eiffel-scholarship-program) to obtain a dual-degree from [École Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr), France, where I spent 2 years and obtained the [Diplôme d'ingénieur (postgraduate degree in engineering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplôme_d%27Ingénieur). After my journey in France, I went back to SJTU to pursue my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at SJTU, where I started my studies on robotics working with Prof. [Wei Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hbaEVRMAAAAJ&hl=en). In 2019, I did a summer internship at the [Intelligent Control Lab](http://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/).
