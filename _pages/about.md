I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. I major in the [Robotics Program](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics/phd-program-robotics) at Georgia Tech's Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines ([IRIM](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics)). My home department is [Aerospace Engineering](https://ae.gatech.edu), and I am fortunately under the supervision of Prof. [Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu). 

My research Interest is probabilistic methods in robotics, and stochastic control. My research centers around understanding the risks that robot faces under these uncertainties, as well as making robots behave robustly under these uncertainties and risks, with a theoretical guarantee. I am interested a broad range of systems and dynamics, such as underactuated systems, hybrid systems, and partially-observed systems. How uncertainty impacts different systems, and how we can develop algorithms to mitegate these impact, are intruiging topics for me.
