I obtained my Ph.D. candidate at Georgia Institute of Technology. I major in the [Robotics Program](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics/phd-program-robotics) at Georgia Tech's Institute for Robotics and Intelligent Machines ([IRIM](https://research.gatech.edu/robotics)). My home department is [Aerospace Engineering](https://ae.gatech.edu), and I am fortunately under the supervision of Prof. [Yongxin Chen](https://yongxin.ae.gatech.edu). 

My research centers around understanding the risks that robot faces under uncertainties, as well as developing methods to make robots behave robustly under these uncertainties and risks, with a theoretical guarantee. My core tools to approach these problems root back into Variational Inference, Stochastic Control, and Diffusion Models.

Here is [my Ph.D. Thesis](https://hzyu17.github.io/hongzheyu.github.io/files/Hongzhe_Yu_Thesis.pdf) which summarizes a few research projects that I have done during my precious Ph.D. time period.


Prior to Georgia Tech, I obtained my Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering from [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn), where I was sponsored by the [Eiffel scholarship program](https://www.campusfrance.org/en/france-excellence-eiffel-scholarship-program) to obtain a dual-degree from [École Centrale de Lyon](https://www.ec-lyon.fr), France, where I spent 2 years and obtained the [Diplôme d'ingénieur (postgraduate degree in engineering)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplôme_d%27Ingénieur). After my journey in France, I went back to SJTU to pursue my Master's degree in Mechanical Engineering at SJTU, where I started my studies on robotics working with Prof. [Wei Dong](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hbaEVRMAAAAJ&hl=en). In 2019, I did a summer internship at the [Intelligent Control Lab](http://icontrol.ri.cmu.edu/).
