Robotic systems in contact with the environment can be modeled as hybrid systems, yet controlling them under disturbances is challenging due to discontinuous jump dynamics, varying state dimensions, and noise-induced timing shifts. 

For \textit{nonlinear} flows, I introduced the Hybrid Path Integral (H-PI) framework, leveraging an analogous ratio among hybrid path distributions to derive the optimal controller via a path integral. Importance sampling with a Hybrid iLQR-based proposal distribution reduces variance, and extensive numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of both methods across various hybrid systems.
