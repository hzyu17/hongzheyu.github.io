Robotic systems in contact with the environment can be modeled as hybrid systems, yet controlling them under disturbances is challenging due to discontinuous jump dynamics, varying state dimensions, and noise-induced timing shifts. 

For \textit{linear} stochastic flows with hybrid transitions, I developed Hybrid Covariance Steering (H-CS) to control state covariances around a mean trajectory, approximating jump dynamics with the Saltation Matrix. When jumps are nonsingular, this yields a closed-form solution; otherwise, a convex optimization over path distributions is formulated via Schrodingerâ€™s Bridge duality, enforcing covariance propagation at hybrid events as equality constraints. This approach scales linearly with the number of jumps, enabling efficient, optimal solutions.
