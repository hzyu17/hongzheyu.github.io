### Controlling Complex Robots

Controlling robots that interact with their environment is difficult because their movements have sudden changes and are affected by noise.

My research introduces the **Hybrid Path Integral (H-PI)** framework to solve this problem for complex, **nonlinear** systems. H-PI finds the best control method by analyzing all possible paths a robot could take.

To make this process more efficient, I used a technique called **importance sampling** with a specific proposal distribution. This approach significantly improved the accuracy of the control system. Our experiments on various robotic systems proved that both methods are effective and reliable.
