### Controlling Robots in Contact with the Environment

Robots that touch things, like a hand gripping an object, are hard to control because their movements involve sudden changes, varying states, and noise. 

My research introduces **Hybrid Covariance Steering (H-CS)**, a method to control these robots. Instead of focusing on every tiny movement, H-CS guides the robot's overall behavior to stay on a desired path.

* For simple changes, a quick, direct solution can be found.
* For more complex changes, the problem is turned into a solvable puzzle.

This approach is highly efficient, as its complexity scales linearly with the number of sudden movements the robot makes. It provides a fast and optimal solution for a challenging problem in robotics.
