### Precision Formation Control

Controlling drone swarms presents significant challenges due to **communication latencies**, **state estimation noise**, and **aerodynamic interference** between agents.

This project implements a **centralized control framework** on a custom micro-drone platform. By leveraging the **Vicon Motion Capture System** for high-precision external state estimation, we achieved coordinated flight and stable formation control despite these inherent hardware limitations.
